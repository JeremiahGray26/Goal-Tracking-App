# Goal-Tracking-App
This is a web app that allows users to create an account and create and delete goals. 
The main technologies used to develop the backend are Node.js, Express, JWT, and Bcrypt.
Node.js and Express are used to develop a RESTful API. JWT and Bcrypt are used to authenticate
and authorize users to access protected endpoints of the web app. Once a user registers and 
creates goals, their credentials and goals are stored in a MongoDB database.

The main technologies used in the frontend are React.js and Redux.js. React simply creates
the design of the web app and Redux handles its' various states.
